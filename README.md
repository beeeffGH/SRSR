# Search &amp; Rescue Swarm Robotics
@author: beeeffGH

## Topic Description
Swarm robotics applies principles from natural swarm behavior (e.g. insects, birds, fish) to coordinate multiple simple robots for complex tasks. In the case of search and rescue scenarios, swarms of robots (also called `agents') can search/map large areas, and potentially perform critical tasks efficiently as a collective while also being robust to individual agent failures. The topic of interest for this project is the implementation, evaluation and testing of coordination algorithms that will enable a group of physical robots to search an unknown environment, and coordinate actions that an individual agent either would accomplish less effectively, or not at all when attempted solo.

## Repository Purpose
This github repo will house the source code for the server-client software that will facilitate communication between swarm members. In addition, this repo will also house the implementation/research notes from the actual testing phase of the pre-existing multi-agent search algorithms when applied to physical robots. This project is for an independent research project with Vancouver Island University.
